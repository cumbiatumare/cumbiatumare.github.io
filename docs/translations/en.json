  "band-intro": "Formed in Erlangen in 2022, Cumbia Tu Mare was born from the union of several Latin friends with a shared passion for music. Since then, we've embarked on an exciting journey, attracting talented musicians from various nationalities and creating a unique blend of musical styles. Currently, we are expanding our repertoire and writing new songs, but also focusing on what we enjoy the most: playing live.",
